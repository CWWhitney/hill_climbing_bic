# Steps to Convert DAG from dagitty to bnlearn: Define the DAG in dagitty syntax.
# Convert the DAG into a bnlearn format - as an adjacency matrix or as a graph in a


# Define the CPTs (Conditional Probability Tables): Once have the network
# structure in bnlearn, will define the CPTs using expert-elicited
# probabilities or data.

# Perform Inference and Optimization: After defining the network,
# perform inference or optimize the model using hill climbing or other methods.
