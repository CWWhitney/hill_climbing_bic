This project aims to validate expert knowledge-based models using hill climbing optimization and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The objective is to compare models derived from expert knowledge against those optimized using hill climbing in R. It contains the
following folders: 

[analysis](./analysis), Contains R scripts for expert-based model implementations.
[data](./data), Datasets required for model training and validation.
[experiments](./experiments), Contains scripts for models optimized with hill climbing
[other](./other), Implementation of the hill climbing algorithm in R.
[preprocessing](./preprocessing). R scripts for model validation using BIC.

- **index/**: RMarkdown files for data analysis and visualization.
