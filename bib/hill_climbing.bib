	abstract = {This study investigates the composition of and preferences by farmers related to trees and crops planted in agroforestry systems, and their role on the livelihood of tribal farmers in a tropical moist deciduous forest in Tangail, Bangladesh. Data was collected from 150 tribal farmers practicing different types of agroforestry systems in Madhupur Sal forest, using a mixed-method strategy that included a survey, focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and direct observation. According to the results, tribal farmers used a total of 22 trees and 33 crop species in their existing agroforestry systems, indicating a rich composition and high diversity. Acacia auriculiformis was the most common tree species (with 82\% of farmers possessing this species), followed by Mangifera indica (75\%), Acacia sp. (73\%), and Gmelina arborea (54\%). Interviews revealed that agroforestry systems have provided numerous benefits and greatly enhanced farmers’ livelihoods through better access to food, timber, fodder, and fuelwood and greater access to livelihood capitals (except social capital). Though agroforestry practices increase species diversity, provide economic returns, and help farmers maintain their livelihoods, tribal farmers face several constraints including bureaucracy and a lack of alternative market facilities. Our study can be of interest for future policy interventions focusing on sustainable reforestation practices, how to solve the problems faced by the farmers, and livelihood improvement in Bangladesh.},

              Agroforestry is seen as a land management technique that can address many of the issues faced by smallholder farmers, such as climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation. Agroforestry helps farmers adapt to extreme weather events, create resilient microclimates for crops and livestock across regions, and help combat climate change. An important role of agroforestry in tackling climate change may be to reduce CO
              2
              emissions by actively sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Soil stores the largest carbon stock (77\%–92\%) in agroforestry systems, with trees, herbaceous plants, and deciduous trees absorbing 7\%–22\% and 1\%, respectively. Smallholder farmers in developing countries not only build resilient agroecological systems that actively absorb carbon, but also revert to more natural production systems that provide better ecological and social functions. By doing so, we can prevent climate change. Agroforestry not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves the resilience of agricultural landscapes, but also can contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation by promoting species migration to more favorable conditions and carbon sequestration. Climate projections could see production declines in much of sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbating food insecurity among citizens.},

So, the aim of this review paper is to compile information on parkland agroforestry practices of Ethiopia, particularly: on tree species diversity, their roles, management options available and challenges of the practice. Parkland agroforestry which is a system practiced by many local populations comprises the large part of agricultural landscapes in Ethiopia and is very important in different aspects such as; for food security, microclimate amelioration, economic benefits, environmental protection, household energy, household utensils, cultural values, traditional medicines, and fodder. There are many indigenous multipurpose tree species scattered on farmlands in Ethiopia, and the common one includes: Millettia ferruginea, Cordia africana, Ficus vasta, Ficus sur, Croton macrostachyus and Faidherbia albida. However, nowadays these trees are facing challenges like: expansion of exotic trees in the expense of the native ones, expansion of cash crops through removal of the parkland trees from the farm area, climate change, land shortage and tenure system which require high emphasis for the production and productivity as well as sustainability of the system especially, in this era of climate change; hence this system is one of climate change mitigation options.},

The purposeful retaining of indigenous trees on farmers’ croplands is recognized as separate from other agroforestry practices. Farmers cultivate indigenous trees for a variety of benefits, including livelihoods, ecosystem services and the existence of scenic and economically valued birds. The adoption of farmland agroforestry has been driven by similar household-level variables that explain the adoption of many other agroforestry practices. However, in contrast to other agroforestry practices farmland agroforestry is not a management priority for farmers, an observation that appears due to a lack of appreciation of naturally occurring trees. Because agroforestry on farmland is declining, interventions are required that improve extension services, availability of indigenous tree seedlings and credit, support reliable legal frameworks and land titles, and foster the processing and value adding of tree products suitable for higher value uses.},

A major source of human-wildlife conflict is crop raiding, which can seriously impact livelihoods and household food security through crop destruction and income loss. This novel research study explores the role of agroforestry trees as one strategy that may improve food security for farmers experiencing wildlife crop raiding. This study draws on household surveys and interviews conducted in 2014-2015 from the communities of Burat and Kinna in Isiolo County, Kenya. From the results, 56\% of research participants reported that agroforestry can provide both income and food in cases of wildlife crop raiding. Common wildlife species reported by respondents were monkeys (163 respondents), elephants (161), porcupines (116), dik-diks (106), gazelles (72), and buffalos (67). Households that could harvest fruit and had a greater diversity of tree species were more likely to report that agroforestry helped when their crops were raided (66.4\% of respondents). The results also suggest two different coping strategies utilized by farmers that improve food security when facing wildlife crop raiding: agroforestry and social networks. Based on this research, policies promoting agroforestry in areas prone to wildlife crop raiding may improve food security for some households.},

	title = {Farmers' strategies for {Adapting} to {Mitigating} {Climate} {Variability} and {Change} through {Agroforestry} in {Ethiopia} and {Kenya}},
	abstract = {Climate change is real and happening in East African countries including Ethiopia and Kenya. Climate change is manifested in the recurrent drought, floods, and famine that have threatened millions of people and livestock in recent decades. Subsistence farming practices are the main livelihood for most people living in this region, which is characterized by degraded soils, small farm sizes, and low agriculture outputs. Agroforestry, which is an ecologically based traditional farming practice, integrates trees into the farming systems to increase agricultural productivity and ameliorate soil fertility, control erosion, conserve biodiversity, and diversify income for households and communities.

In early 2011, Oregon State University was invited by the World Agroforestry Center to renew institutional collaboration for student and faculty exchanges, exchange scientific information, and to collaborate in agroforestry research and outreach. As part of this initiative an Agroforestry synthesis paper was proposed on farmers’ adaptation and mitigation to climate variability and change through agroforestry practices in Ethiopia and Kenya. The purpose of the synthesis paper was to document traditional and scientific knowledge on how farmers cope with climate variability and change. Four case studies were identified from highland farming and dryland pastoral systems in both Ethiopia and Kenya. The Gedeo Home garden from Ethiopia and Meru highland farming from Kenya were identified as good representatives of highland farming. The Afar pastoral system and Kibwezi district dryland farming from Kenya were identified as good representatives of dryland farming systems. The lead authors for each chapter were selected based on their experiences working in the case study areas, and are knowledgeable of the farming systems and constraints thereof.

The synthesis paper has helped us document information from the respective case study areas, including both the traditional ecological knowledge and the current agroforestry practices in the context of climate change. By no means is the information in this paper exhaustive, but it gives a better understanding of the situation currently faced by these countries. The paper suggests scaling up some of the already available agroforestry practices in these countries and identifying gaps in knowledge, which then point to what kinds of agroforestry research should be conducted to address climate change mitigation and adaptation in the future.

This paper has brought together scientists from various education and research institutions in Ethiopia and Kenya with expertise in agriculture, agroforestry, plant genetics, agroforestry, and economics and social sciences. This concourse has helped us understand the importance of interdisciplinary work to address complex natural resources management issues from ecological, economic and social issues. We hope this collaborative effort will continue beyond the literature synthesis and create opportunities for future collaboration in agroforestry education, research, outreach, and student and faculty exchange among the involved institutions.},

We compared households belonging to 432 pre-existing farmer groups operating in 60 program villages and 61 matched comparison villages. To address potential self-selection bias, we used program targeting as an instrument for program participation, combined with the difference-in-differences approach to control for time-invariant differences between our treatment and comparison groups. We complemented the above with semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of 40 purposively selected program participants. Despite evidence of variable program exposure and agroforestry uptake, we found modest, yet statistically significant, effects of Vi Agroforestry’s program on intermediate outcomes, such as agroforestry product income, fuelwood access, and milk yields among dairy farmers. We also found that this program modestly increased asset holdings, particularly among households represented by female program participants.},

In this study, we mapped the relationship between agroforestry tree survival in villages that were a part of the Vi Agroforestry project in the Mara region, Tanzania with key social-ecological variables. A random sample of 21 households from each of 89 investigated project villages was used. The proportion of households with surviving agroforestry trees, varied from 10\%–90\% among villages. Social and ecological differences between villages were important explanations to this variation. Variables related to the project and its operations explained most of the inter-village variation in households with few surviving trees. To encourage the majority of village households to practice agroforestry their perceptions of tree ownership and the benefit of agroforestry were additional key factors to the project showing the importance of socio-cultural issues to the households’ decisions to continue beyond the initial tree planting and testing phase.},

The results show that 26\% of households practice a form of FMNR involving both pruning and protecting woody vegetation. Adoption is strongly linked to soil type, market access, and the education level of the head of household. FMNR raises household income and increases crop diversity, household migration rates, and the density and diversity of trees on farmland. It is estimated that FMNR raises the annual gross income of the region by between 17 and 21 million USD and has contributed an additional 900,000 to 1,000,000 trees to the local environment. These findings support the value of continued promotion of FMNR as an inexpensive means of enhancing rural livelihoods and an attractive alternative to reforestation efforts relying on tree planting.},

	abstract = {Farmer–grazier conflicts are a major cause of the stagnated development experienced in rural, peri-urban, and suburban areas across Africa and the developing world, as these conflicts often lead to the loss of crops, livestock, and even human lives, precipitating untold misery and excruciating poverty. In Cameroon where this study was undertaken, the situation is simply pathetic as farmer–grazier conflicts occur regularly, especially during the dry season when herders move livestock (especially cattle, sheep and horses) from hills to the valleys (transhumance), in search of pasture, destroying farmers’ crops in the process. It is within this framework that this study sought to look at the contribution of agroforestry practices to farmer–grazier conflict mitigation. Data collection methods for the study were household surveys, key informant interviews and direct observations. Data analysis was done through descriptive and inferential statistics, using two main statistical analyses software: Microsoft Excel 2007 and SPSS 20. Findings revealed that the main cause of farmer–grazier conflicts was limited arable and grazing land (100\%), with the main consequences being loss of human lives and crops/livestock (100\%). The main agroforestry practices of farmers were home gardens with animals (52\%), trees on croplands (60\%) and live fences/hedges (52\%) while graziers’ agroforestry practices were home gardens with animals (73\%), trees on grazing lands (60\%) and live fences/hedges (53\%). Agroforestry was found to provide many socio-economic and ecosystem benefits to both farmers and graziers like food, fuelwood, fodder, building materials and shade which make farmers and graziers less interdependent. Correlation analysis revealed a strong inverse relationship between the practice of agroforestry and farmer–grazier conflicts (p {\textless} 0.01). Chi square test statistic showed a significant relationship between agroforestry practices and farmer–grazier conflicts (p {\textless} 0.01). Parameter estimates of the Binary Logistic Regression model revealed that three main agroforestry practices (home garden with animals, trees on crop/grazing lands and home garden) were determinant in mitigating farmer–grazier-conflicts (p {\textless} 0.01). This clearly demonstrates that the practice of agroforestry can contribute in a sustainable way to end recurrent farmer–grazier conflicts. The study therefore recommends that more attention be directed towards agroforestry by policy makers and other stakeholders who seek to mitigate the farmer–grazier conflict hot potato.},

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that hunger impacts roughly one-third of the global populace, with over one-third of those suffering from undernourishment concentrated in Africa. Agroforestry has emerged as a promising soil fertility improvement technology to address these food security challenges. This study utilizes an endogenous switching regression model, complemented with coarsened exact matching, to ascertain the effects of adopting agroforestry on household food security. We used data from a sample of 615 farms in Southern Rwanda. The findings indicate that the main determinants of agroforestry adoption include secure land tenure, membership in cooperatives, access to credit, household size, and farmers' awareness of agroforestry practices. Findings highlight the substantial contributions of agroforestry to food security, with adopters experiencing 19.81 percentage points higher food consumption scores compared to non-adopters. Moreover, the results reveal potential benefits for non-adopters through agroforestry adoption, thereby suggesting that even individuals who do not currently engage in agroforestry could enhance their food security by considering adoption. These insights emphasize the long-term potential of promoting agroforestry for current and prospective adopters. Policies reinforcing land security, supporting cooperatives, providing accessible credit, and promoting farmer sensitization are crucial for encouraging agroforestry adoption and improving food security. By identifying key determinants and quantifying impacts, this study offers targeted guidance for interventions that leverage agroforestry as a sustainable solution to enhance household food security.},

	abstract = {Fruit tree–based agroforestry has been promoted as an alternative farming practice in upland Northwest Vietnam to replace monocultures of staple crops. Although many studies have focused on evaluating the performance of agroforestry systems at the plot level, research on how farmers perceive and evaluate agroforestry considering whole-farm contexts is limited. We explored the perceptions and reasoned management decisions of agroforestry farmers to uncover challenges that hinder the wider use of agroforestry, and we assessed farmers’ strategies for effective management of adoption challenges. We combined the Q methodology and the systems thinking approach. With the Q methodology, we explored prevalent discourses among the members of the farming community on the impact of agroforestry. Systems thinking elucidated a system-wide understanding of farmers’ adaptive decision-making processes. By combining the two approaches, we uncovered the dynamics that shape farmers’ perceptions and the rationale behind their management of the adoption process. Through the Q method, we identified three distinct discourses among participants. Two of these discourses are in favor of agroforestry, highlighting its beneficial impacts on livelihoods and the environment, e.g., through diversification of household income and through soil erosion control. We also generated a collective development pathway outlining how farmers navigated and adapted agroforestry practices to overcome adoption challenges through a whole-system approach to farm resource management. We identified structural barriers, such as unstable farm-gate prices, that may need high-level interventions. Our study adds a new dimension to the assessment of agroforestry through farmers’ perspectives and contributes to the existing body of research on knowledge systems in agroforestry. Considering farmers’ views and their ways of reasoning during innovation processes may allow tailoring appropriate innovations by accounting for unique farm situations and local farming systems. Such locally generated knowledge will have relevance for real-world contexts and therefore be useful for guiding actions.},
